# Telecom_clustering

This case uses Peru's ERESTEL 2021 survey of telecom providers to identify business opportunities for the second major mobile carrier. The dataset identifies the carriers for each observation, so it allows us to focus explicitely on the company's clients. 

This case proposes a methodology to identify prepaid customers that are more likely to migrate to postpaid plans. I use kmeans and agglomerative clustering to identify a list of prepaid customers to target in a new campaign.

The notebook simplifies the survey into a manageable dataframe and conducts datawrangling to code variables in English for ease of use.
