# Telecom_clustering

This case uses Peru's ERESTEL survey of telecom providers to identify business opportunities for the second major mobile carrier. The dataset identifies the carriers for each observation, so it allows us to focus explicitely on the company's clients. 

The case proposes a methodology to identify prepaid customers that are more likely to migrate to postpaid plans for a new sales campaign. I use kmeans and agglomerative clustering to identify a list of prepaid customers to migrate.
